      <p>
			Welcome to the informal meeting around Anonymous Credentials!
			</p>
      <p>
			The topic is, of course, Anonymous Credentials, a construction that tries to solve the problem of needing to propagate trust signals while protecting anonymity.
      </p>
      <p>
			These informal meetings started in 2021 at <a href="https://www.sofiaceli.com/Anonymous-Credentials-Meeting/meeting-2020.html">RWC2021</a>. The purpose of these meetings is to bring together people that are either working on anonymous credentials, implementing them or interested on them. We aim to discuss the new advances on this topic, to generate new avenues of collaboration, and to create a community.

				<p><strong>How to Register</strong></p>
        <p>Registration is free; but you must be aware of the SNAPL Friendly Environment Policy.</p>
        <p>We require that every participant represent themselves by the name that they use for their professional work (this can be a pseudonym that they generally use for their professional work). No participant can impersonate another person.</p>
				<p>On the Internet, signing up is cheap. Showing up is hard. Check your calendar to make sure you're free, and block off the dates: commit to participating before you sign up. Do not sign up until you've blocked out the dates in your calendar.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, we understand that things can change. If you have signed up but won't be participating, let us know.</p>
