			Welcome to the informal meeting around Anonymous Credentials!
			</p>
      <p>
			The topic is, of course, Anonymous Credentials, a construction that tries to solve the problem of needing to propagate trust signals while protecting anonymity.
      </p>
      <p>
			These informal meetings started in 2021 at <a href="https://www.sofiaceli.com/Anonymous-Credentials-Meeting/meeting-2020.html">RWC2021</a>. The purpose of these meetings is to bring together people that are either working on anonymous credentials, implementing them or interested on them. We aim to discuss the new advances on this topic, to generate new avenues of collaboration, and to create a community.
