# Welcome to the Anonymous Credentials Meeting!


Find me on [github](https://github.com/claucece/Anonymous-Credentials-Meeting)!

This is an informal meeting to be held at [Real World Crypto 2021](https://rwc.iacr.org/2021/).

What is an informal meeting? It is a far-less planned meeting where people interested
in the topic come together and discuss ideas!

What is the topic? The topic is Anonymous Credentials, a construction that
tries to solve the problem of needing to propagate trust signals while protecting
anonymity.

This form takes inspiration from the [pl-hci-school-2020](https://shriram.github.io/pl-hci-school-2020/)
organized by Sarah Chasins, Elena Glassman, Shriram Krishnamurthi and Hila Peleg,
and by the [Fourteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium, ANTS-XIV](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/ANTS/index.html)
organized by Steven Galbraith.

# Information
